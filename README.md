# Chicago Public School Project

Introduction

    This repository is a spin-off from a group project I had done with Syd Rothman at Flatiron School. The original project can be found here (https://github.com/sydroth/CPSdata). 
    The whole idea of analyzing CPS (Chicago Public School) dataset came rather whimsically-I was watching DNC presidential debate one night and the guy I could relate to most (Andrew Yang) said the following:
    
    "70-75% of kids' academic performance is determined by out-of-school factors: 
    parental time, income, neighborhood, and etc. Putting resources into families' 
    hands would improve kids' abilities to learn."
    
It all made sense; of course the other factors matter. The question was that would it show? "Well, it should," I thought. And that's how this project began.

Metrics to consider:
  1. Student Growth Rating (SGR)
    - SGR measures the percent increase in standardized exam scores in course of two years and compares them to the national average. 1: below average, 2: average, 3: above average, 4: far above average
  2. Hardship index
    - Amalgamation of unemployment, education, per capita income, poverty, crowded housing, dependency. Ranked by neighborhood (lower the better)
  
Progression
  1. Dataset acquired from Chicago Data Portal
  2. Exploratory data analysis has been performed
  3. Two hypotheses has been tested
  4. The findings have been presented
  5. Further research is underway.
